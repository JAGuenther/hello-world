Ello!

My name is King Robert Baratheon: First of my name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, King of the Rhoynar, Master of the Andals. etc. etc..  I like to drink wine, and frequent the slums of kings landing to do twatever I want.  Its good to be the king.  Just don't go boar hunting when you've had 4 + flaggons of wine.  Trust me...
